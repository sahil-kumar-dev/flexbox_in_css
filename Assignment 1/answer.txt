CSS Flexbox Layout Model:

One-Dimensional: Flexbox is primarily designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column. It's ideal for arranging items along a single axis, such as horizontally or vertically.
Content-Focused: Flexbox is well-suited for distributing space along the main axis and aligning items along the cross-axis. It's often used for aligning content within a container.
Dynamic Sizing: It automatically adjusts the size of items to fit the available space along the main axis, which makes it great for accommodating variable content sizes.
Ordering: Flexbox allows you to easily change the order of elements within the container using the order property.
CSS Grid Layout Model:

CSS grid box layout model:

Two-Dimensional: Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, which means it can create both rows and columns simultaneously. This makes it more versatile for complex layouts.
Grid Control: It offers precise control over rows and columns, allowing you to define their sizes and positions explicitly. You can also create grids with equal-sized or responsive tracks.
Grid Lines: Grid introduces the concept of grid lines, which provide precise positioning of items within the grid container.
Item Placement: You can place items anywhere in the grid, and items don't have to be in a linear order like in Flexbox.
